        <br />
        We collect personal information when you create an account, place an order, or interact with our website in other ways. This information may

        send you marketing communications, but you can opt out of these at any time.
        <br />
        <br />
        We take appropriate measures to protect the security of your personal information. However, no website can guarantee the absolute security of
        your data, so please be cautious about providing personal information online.

        We may also disclose your personal information if required to do so by law or in response to a valid request from a law enforcement or
        government agency.
        <br />
        <br />
        We may update this privacy policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or legal requirements. We will post any changes on
        this page and encourage you to review our privacy policy periodically.
